1. **Name**: ThereMax
2. **Description**:
This project simulates the working of a musical instrument, the theremin. It allows users to control pitch and volume with the wave of green and red colored objects and allows you to create recordings

3. **Running the file**: The main file that must be run is Theremin.py. Before running the file, make sure you have a good Internet connection and that the main folder contains "BeginningMusic.wav"

4. The libraries that must be installed are: Python 3.6 or above must be installed
```
1.pygame
2.pyAudio
3.pyo
4.opencv
5.threading
6.cmu_112_graphics.py
7.numpy
8. wave
```

**Shortcuts**: None

**A few instructions**:
1. Choose very distinctly red and green objects
2. The optimum distance between the objects and the camera is 20-25cm
3. As the range of the camera is quite small, the red object moves approxiamately 5cm on either side of the centre
4. For best results, play the instrument in a well-lit room with a white wall (no other red and green objects)
